This is a base quickstart app. Right now it lets you log in with a base wallet and has some dummy page content.

I want to make an educational quickstart for Story and Base developers. My goal is to add Story integration to this Base Quickstart.

Here is my future vision for this app: I want it to show an NFT Mint Card (using Base Onchainkit's NFTMintCard: https://docs.base.org/onchainkit/mint/nft-mint-card), and allow users to purchase it on Base Sepolia. When this happens, it should trigger a payment using deBridge to pay cross-chain royalties to an IP Asset on Story. I previously wrote a tutorial for how this can be done here: https://docs.story.foundation/developers/tutorials/cross-chain-royalty-payments (although that uses Eth mainnet).

That's pretty much it!
